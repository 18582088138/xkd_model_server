# OpenVINO&trade; Model Server

OpenVINO&trade; Model Server is a scalable, high-performance solution for serving machine learning models optimized for Intel&reg; architectures. 
The server provides an inference service via gRPC endpoint or REST API -- making it easy to deploy new algorithms and AI experiments using the same 
architecture as [TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving) for any models trained in a framework that is supported 
by [OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit). 

The server implements gRPC interface and REST API framework with data serialization and deserialization using TensorFlow Serving API,
 and OpenVINO&trade; as the inference execution provider. Model repositories may reside on a locally accessible file system (e.g. NFS),
  Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Amazon S3 or MinIO.
  
OVMS is now implemented in C++ and provides much higher scalability compared to its predecessor in Python version.
You can take advantage of all the power of Xeon CPU capabilities or AI accelerators and expose it over the network interface.


## Building

Build the docker image using command:
 
```bash
~/ovms-c$ make docker_build
```
It will generate the image, tagged as `ovms:latest`.


## Running the serving component as a docker container:
Docker container is using the serving application as the entrypoint, so you just need to pass its parameters in the docker command:
```bash
docker run -d -v /models/model_folder:/opt/ml:ro -p 9178:9178 ovms --model_name <model_name> --model_path /opt/ml --port 9178
```
All parameters are documented below:

## Testing

### Python prerequisites

To use Makefile targets which operate on Python it is required to have:
* Python >= 3.6
* `virtualenv` package installed system-wide:
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Testing inference with an arbitrary model

You can download an exemplary model using script `tests/performance/download_model.sh`. It is ResNet50 quantized to INT8 precision.
The script stores the model in the user home folder. You can use any other model from OpenVINO model zoo.

When the docker container is started like in the example above, use and adjust the following grpc client:

```bash
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 tests/performance/grpc_latency.py --images_numpy_path tests/performance/imgs.npy --labels_numpy_path tests/performance/labels.npy \
 --iteration 1000 --batchsize 1 --report_every 100 --input_name data
```

`images_numpy_path` parameter should include numpy array with a batch of input data.

`labels_numpy_path` includes a numpy array with image classification results for the test dataset to measure accuracy.

### Running functional tests

```bash
make test_functional
``` 
Default tests configuration can be changed by usage of environment variables. 
To store them in a file, create `user_config.py` in the main directory of the project.
The following variables are available for customization:

`IMAGE` - docker image name which should be used to run tests.

`TEST_DIR` -  location where models and test data should be downloaded.

`LOG_LEVEL` - set log level.

`BUILD_LOGS` - path to dir where artifacts should be stored.

`START_CONTAINER_COMMAND` - command to start ovms container.

`CONTAINER_LOG_LINE` - log line to check in container to confirm that it has started properly.

Example usage:

```bash
os.environ["IMAGE"] = "ie-serving-py:latest"
```

There's also an option to specify these variables in environment via command line by using export, e.g.:
```bash
export IMAGE="ie-serving-py:latest"
```

### Running basic performance tests

Automated tests are configure to use ResNet50 model quantized to INT8 precision.    

```bash
make test_perf

### Running tests on Python image

WARNING: at this point not all tests will pass. Further changes are needed to achieve that.

To run tests (test_batching, test_mapping, test_single_model) on Python image specify following variables in user_config.py or in environment by using export:
```
os.environ["START_CONTAINER_COMMAND"] = "/ie-serving-py/start_server.sh ie_serving model "
os.environ["CONTAINER_LOG_LINE"] = "server listens on port"
```

To run tests (test_model_version_policy, test_model_versions_handling, test_multi_models) on Python image specify following variables in user_config.py or in environment by using export:
```
os.environ["START_CONTAINER_COMMAND"] = "/ie-serving-py/start_server.sh ie_serving config "
os.environ["CONTAINER_LOG_LINE"] = "server listens on port"
```

## Server Logging
OpenVINOâ„¢ model server accepts 3 logging levels:

* ERROR: Logs information about inference processing errors and server initialization issues.
* INFO: Presents information about server startup procedure.
* DEBUG: Stores information about client requests.

The default setting is INFO, which can be altered by setting environment variable LOG_LEVEL.

The captured logs will be displayed on the model server console. While using docker containers or kubernetes the logs can be examined using `docker logs` or `kubectl logs` commands respectively.

It is also possible to save the logs to a local file system by configuring parameter `log_path` with the absolute path pointing to a log file. Please see example below for usage details.

```bash
docker run --name ie-serving --rm -d -v /models/:/opt/ml:ro -p 9001:9001 ovms:latest \
--config_path /opt/ml/config.json --port 9001 --log_level=DEBUG --log_path=/var/log/ie_serving.log
 
docker logs ie-serving 
```

## Developer guide

Mount the source code inside the docker container
```bash
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/ovms --entrypoint bash -p 9178:9178 ovms:latest 
```

Compile code using command:

```bash
bazel build //src:ovms
```

Run single unit test with flag "--test_filter", e.g.:

```bash
bazel test --test_summary=detailed --test_output=all --test_filter='ModelVersionStatus.*' //src:ovms_test
```

Run build on shared machine with extra makefile flags:

```bash
OVMS_CPP_DOCKER_IMAGE=rr_ovms OVMS_CPP_CONTAINTER_PORT=9278 make docker_build
```
